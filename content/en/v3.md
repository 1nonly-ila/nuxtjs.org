## Nitro Engine

After 9 months of development, we worked on a new server engine for Nuxt, we called it Nitro. 

- Hybrid deployment: server and static rendering, best of both world
- Lightweight build: output without any dependencies
- Universal output: Deploy to any hosting including Node.js, Serverless, Workers, Edge-side Rendering and Static/JAMStack
- Fullstack support: API & Functions (with HMR in development)
- Native storage layer: Multi source strorage layer built-in with local asset support
- Powered by H3: powerful, minimal and universal JS server compatible with express middleware
- [Soon] Agnostic server framework support: Fastify, Express, Connect, Koa

# Nuxt Bridge

Nuxt brige project aims to make the transition between Nuxt/Vue 2 to Nuxt/Vue 3 as smooth as possible.

## Smooth upgrade to Nuxt 3

We worked on making the upgrade as easy as possible by keeping many Nuxt 2 syntax into Nuxt 3:

- Legacy plugins working (ctx, inject)
- Legacy modules working
- Nuxt config is compatible
- Partial options API (asyncData)

## Bringing Nuxt 3 experience to your exisisting Nuxt 2 project

We worked on new features for Nuxt 3 that we backported to Nuxt 2.

- Using Nitro with nuxt 2
- Using composition api with nuxt 2
- Using new CLI and Devtools with nuxt 2
- Progressibely upgrade to Nuxt 3
- Compatibility with Nuxt2 module ecosystem
- Upgrade piece by piece (Nitro, Composition API, Nuxt Kit)
