## Nitro Engine

After 9 months of development, we created a new server engine for Nuxt, called Nitro. 

- Hybrid deployment: server and static rendering, featuring the best of both worlds
- Lightweight build: output without any dependencies
- Universal output: deploy to any hosting platform including Node.js, Serverless, Workers, Edge-side Rendering and Static/JAMStack
- Fullstack support: API & Functions (with HMR in development)
- Native storage layer: built-in multi-source storage layer with local asset support
- Powered by h3: powerful, minimal and universal JS server compatible with express middleware
- [Soon] Agnostic server framework support: Fastify, Express, Connect, Koa

## Nuxt Bridge

The Nuxt Bridge project aims to make the transition between Nuxt/Vue 2 to Nuxt/Vue 3 as smooth as possible.

### Smooth upgrade to Nuxt3

We've worked to make the upgrade as easy as possible between Nuxt2 and Nuxt3.

- Legacy plugins working (ctx, inject)
- Legacy modules support
- Nuxt config is compatible
- Partial options API (asyncData, head, layout and more)

### Bringing Nuxt3 experience to your exisisting Nuxt2 project

As we've been working on new features for Nuxt3, we've backported some of them to Nuxt2.

- Using Nitro with Nuxt2
- Using Composition api with Nuxt2
- Using new CLI and Devtools with Nuxt2
- Progressively upgrade to Nuxt3
- Compatibility with Nuxt2 module ecosystem
- Upgrade piece by piece (Nitro, Composition API, Nuxt Kit)
